                Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America.
                When a report came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been
                seen forty-five miles south of London, they didn't pay much
                attention. However, more and more reports came, so the experts
                from the zoo felt they should find out the truth.

                They began to search for the puma in a small village where a
                woman saw a large cat only five yards away from her. It ran
                away as soon as she saw it. The experts said that a puma will
                not attack a person unless it is cornered. The search was
                difficult, for the puma was often seen at one place in the
                morning and at an other place twenty miles away in the evening.
